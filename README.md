# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction

This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning and deep learning models. By analyzing customer behavior and service usage data, we can help businesses identify which customers are likely to leave, enabling proactive retention strategies.

## 🧠 Key Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Traditional ML models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc.)  
- Deep Learning model using TensorFlow (ANN)  
- Model evaluation using metrics and visualizations  
- Prediction on new/unseen data  

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains customer information such as:

- Demographics (gender, age, etc.)
- Services subscribed
- Tenure, monthly charges, total charges
- Churn status (target variable)
